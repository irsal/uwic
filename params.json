{"name":"Women in Computing","tagline":"Launching a Diversity in Computing Organization at your university","body":"#OVERVIEW\r\nHumans prosper because of an innate need for relationships and interactions from like-minded individuals. Have you ever felt alienated, isolated and unequal to your peers in Computer Science? Ever considered starting your own organization at your university, but don’t know where to start? The focus of this talk is to give you the practical tools and advice to start your own Diversity in Computing Organization at your university. \r\n\r\n\r\n#GOALS\r\n* Start a diversity in computing organization at your school/company\r\n* Inspire others to study computing sciences\r\n\r\n\f\r\n#GUIDE\r\n**Step 1: Find another person or persons to help you. **Having another person there when you are busy with exams and problem sets can help distribute the workload of starting an organization. It helps alleviate a lot of your stress when you know someone has your back.\r\n\r\nPotential pitfall: if your work styles are not complementary, that can cause some tension. This is more common than you think. Bring it up earlier rather than later, and resolve in a way that seems fair to both parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Step 2: Define your organization’s objectives.** I know it seems trivial, but this is the most important step. Make sure you understand what your objectives are before you start talking to faculty or administrators, or raising money for your organization. For example, it took us a whole year before we realized our goals are: community, awareness and advocacy.\r\nPotential pitfall: it is very easy to glance over this step. When you think “OBVIOUSLY, the goal is to have more women in tech,” the lack of specificity is a real issue when trying to bring up the real issues within your university. \r\n\r\nLet me help you out, the Rule of Three is very effective for objective setting:\r\nGoal 1: ___________________________________________ \r\nGoal 2: ___________________________________________ \r\nGoal 2: ___________________________________________ \r\n\r\n\r\n**Step 3: Brand your organization. ** Ask a Photoshop or Illustrator whiz to create your logo, or just gun it and do it yourself. The 30 day free trial Adobe offers is all you need to get you started. If nothing else, just steal someone else’s logo. Here you go: https://www.facebook.com/NUwic/ \r\n\r\n\r\n**Step 4: Find at least one faculty member that wholeheartedly supports your objectives from Step 2. **This step may take some time, since most universities don’t necessarily have faculty/staff that are willing to help your objectives from Step 2. Because of that, do not wait for faculty support to continue to Step 5. If this is a blocker because of the red tape at your university, then the best faculty member to ask would be one that is already advising another diversity organization (like SWE or NSBE).\r\n\r\nPotential pitfall: this step can be very discouraging. We almost chose not to continue the pursuit, but it is worth it to remember your goals from Step 2. There must be a story or experience that you’ve had that has led you to starting the process, so remember it.\r\n\r\nRemember when __________________________________________________ .\r\nThat’s why I started this organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Step 5: Start a mailing list via MailChimp. ** This is your list of members. Go to all the CS classes you can, and have every woman in that class (grad students included) sign up and join. Promise not to spam them. Also, poach other people at other mailing lists.\r\nPotential pitfall: this mailing list is inclusive, so it should allow for male supporters as well. Don’t forget that grad students are students too!\r\n\r\n\r\n**Step 6: Send out a meaningful email about your organization’s objectives to the mailing list you have created.**\r\nPotential pitfall: it is very easy to glance over this step. When you think “OBVIOUSLY, the goal is to have more women in tech,” the lack of specificity is a real issue when trying to bring up the real issues within your university. \r\nHere’s an excerpt from ours:\r\n“NUWiC is a new organization that strives to provide an academic and social support system to females in the Computer Science Community (EECS). We all know what it's like to be one of only a few girls in a lecture classroom, and how it can feel isolating to not know m/any female upperclassmen, professors, or advisers to turn to for guidance.\r\nWe are asking for more of women to get involved in WiC's cause. As the representatives of females in the CS community, it is our duty to excel and to bring about change in CS fields that we have been historically underrepresented in. Below we have a list of ways to get involved in WiC in as much or as little as you wish.”\r\n\r\n\r\n**Step 7: File the right paperwork. Probably the easiest and most satisfying step once you have Steps 1 through 6 done.**\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 8: Brainstorm event ideas. Here are some that we hosted:\r\n* Puzzle competition. Winners got FitBits\r\n* Free Friday Dinners\r\n* Organizing a party/rager for CS majors (where women actually showed up, since we helped organize it)\r\n* Tech Talks with large tech companies (also doubles as a recruiting event)\r\n\r\nPotential pitfall: the events don’t have to be that complicated. Honestly, if you just allow all these technical women to sit in the same room and encourage ideas and interactions, you’re already doing more than you think.\r\nStep 9: Find money to fund events. This is by far the most annoying and cumbersome step. (Pro-tip: recruit a Treasurer that actually enjoys accounting-type things so that the financials will be well-attended to.) Basically, you have to find sponsors (aka people/orgs that will give you money). Here’s a list of sponsors we’ve gotten (in order of easiest to hardest to get):\r\nYour university (our biggest donor is Northwestern University’s McCormick School of Engineering)\r\nSponsorship programs through your university (our second biggest donor is Boeing Corp via a donation fund in our university)\r\nLarge Tech Companies (they basically throw money at diversity programs, I kid you not…If you need help with email templates, email me: irsal@blendlabs.com)\r\nStartups. Surprisingly, they have a whole lot of money allocated for ‘recruiting’ which is how you can convince them to send you money (perhaps a resume book in exchange for funding an event).\r\nAlumni techies from your university (thanks, Ben Slivka).\r\nWorst case scenario, your members. Lizz and I had the philosophy of don’t charge your members anything to keep the community inclusive, so we never resolved to do this. I’m talking free attendance/boarding/travel to the Grace Hopper Conference, free Northwestern WiC swag, etc. We decided early on that we wanted to be inclusive across majors, genders and socio-economic status.\r\n\r\nPotential pitfall: emailing is the least effective method to ask for money. Show your face. Make sure you have one-on-one meetings with potential sponsors. Yes, that includes your own CS department heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Step 10: Get the word out about events you’re hosting.** Luckily, you already have your mailing list setup, so you just have to blast it.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Step 11: Talk to administration directly and have them acknowledge your existence.** The primary objective of these talks is to persuade them of the benefits your organization can have on their school/department. The sad yet true fact of the matter is that a lot of administrators don’t see the point of having a diversity in computing organization.\r\n\r\nPotential pitfall: administrators are very “slick.” They’ll say they support you, but you won’t really know until they put their money where their mouth is. So while the primary objective is to show face, the secondary objective is to secure future cash flow from these people.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Step 12: Attend community recruiting events like Welcome Week.** You may not get too many freshman females declared as CS majors from the get go, but your presence during your university’s Welcome Week extracurricular “fair” definitely plants that seed in their mind that it is an option to major in CS.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
